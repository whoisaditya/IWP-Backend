# YourStore 
COVID-19 has adversely affected the lives of everyone. However, one of the most affected communities is that of the local Kirana stores running in localities. Where the other larger economically stable powerhouses like that of Big Basket and Amazon were able to captivate a larger audience, local stores failed to amass wealth due to social distancing, unavailability of items. YourStore is a local e-commerce store to help local shops repair their losses. The Online Grocery System application enables shopkeepers to set up online shops, customers to browse through the shops, and maintain lists of shop categories. The website enables the shopkeepers to manage the items in the shop and also help customers to purchase them online without visiting the shop physically. The online shopping system will use the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers.
